Read [Robustness testing using proxies](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/robustness-testing-using-proxies/)
and [Give browser a chance](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/give-browser-a-chance/).

Uses [connect-slow](https://github.com/bahmutov/connect-slow) and 
[connect-stop](https://github.com/bahmutov/connect-stop) internally.

Install `npm install -g turtle-run`

Run `turtle-run <config json file | turtle.json by default>`

Create `turtle.json` local config file. Example:

```json
{
  "target": "http://localhost:3003",
  "port": 8008,
  "debug": true,
  "urls": {
    ".js$": 2000,
    "app.js": 2000,
    ".html$": 1000,
    "foo.js$": { "response": 500 }
  }
}
```

Start *turtle-run* in the folder with *turtle.json*. The proxy watches the file and restarts on any changes.
In the above case, the proxy will listen on local port 8008 and forward any requests to `http://localhost:3003`.
Requests containing `.js` at the end will be delayed by 2 seconds. JavaScript file `app.js` will be delayed by
4 seconds (2 seconds for every js file and 2 seconds because it matches `app.js`). HTML files will be delayed 
by 1 second. All other requests will not be delayed.

The proxy will also return code 500 for resource `foo.js`.

`debug` flag tells proxy to output request information to console log.
